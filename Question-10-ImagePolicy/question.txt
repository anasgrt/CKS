Context:
ImagePolicyWebhook is an admission controller that allows you to validate
container images against an external service before allowing pods to be created.

Task:
A directory has been created at /etc/kubernetes/epconfig/ for your configuration files.

1. Enable the `ImagePolicyWebhook` admission controller in the kube-apiserver:
   - Add `ImagePolicyWebhook` to `--enable-admission-plugins`
   - Set `--admission-control-config-file` to point to the admission config file

2. Create the ImagePolicyWebhook configuration file (admission_config.yaml) with:
   - Set `defaultAllow` to `false` (deny images by default when webhook is unreachable)
   - Configure the `kubeConfigFile` path

3. Create the kubeconfig file for the webhook backend with:
   - Set the `server` URL to: https://image-policy-webhook.default.svc:443/image_policy
   - Ensure proper certificate configuration

4. Ensure the API server mounts the necessary volumes for the configuration files

Save copies to:

- /opt/course/10/kubeconfig.yaml
