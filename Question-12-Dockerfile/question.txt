Weight: 7%
Domain: Supply Chain Security (20%)
Difficulty: Medium

Context:
A Dockerfile and a Kubernetes Deployment manifest are provided.
Both files contain security issues that do not follow best practices.

Task:
Analyze and fix the security issues in both files.

1. Analyze the Dockerfile at /opt/course/12/Dockerfile and fix:
   - Running as root user (add USER instruction with non-root user)
   - Using `latest` tag for base image (use specific version)
   - Using `ADD` instead of `COPY` for local files

2. Analyze the Deployment manifest at /opt/course/12/deployment.yaml and fix:
   - Container running as privileged (set privileged: false)
   - Container can escalate privileges (set allowPrivilegeEscalation: false)
   - Container not running as non-root (set runAsNonRoot: true)
   - Root filesystem is writable (set readOnlyRootFilesystem: true)

Save the fixed files to:
- /opt/course/12/Dockerfile-fixed
- /opt/course/12/deployment-fixed.yaml
