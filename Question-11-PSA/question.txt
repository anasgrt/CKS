Context:
A namespace (team-blue) has Pod Security Admission configured with the `restricted`
level in `enforce` mode. Several pods exist in this namespace, but some were created
before the policy was enforced and do not comply with the `restricted` Pod Security Standard.

Task:
1. Use `kubectl label --dry-run=server` to identify pods that violate the Pod Security Standard:
   - kubectl label --dry-run=server --overwrite ns team-blue pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted

2. Review the warnings to identify non-compliant pods

3. Delete the pods that do not comply with the `restricted` policy

4. The compliant pods should remain running

Save the following:
- The warning output from dry-run: /opt/course/11/violations.txt
- Names of deleted pods: /opt/course/11/deleted-pods.txt
- The kubectl command used: /opt/course/11/command.txt
