Difficulty: Easy

Context:
You need to analyze the software components inside a container image
for supply chain security purposes using multiple SBOM tools.

Task:
Use the following container image for all tasks:

   nginx:1.25-alpine@sha256:721fa00bc549df26b3e67cc558ff176112d4ba69847537766f3c28e171d180e7

   (This is the linux/amd64 variant)

1. Use the `bom` tool to generate an SBOM in SPDX format:
   Save the SBOM to: /opt/course/04/sbom.spdx

2. Use `trivy` to generate an SBOM in SPDX-JSON format:
   Save the SBOM to: /opt/course/04/sbom.spdx.json

3. Use `trivy` to scan the generated SPDX-JSON SBOM for vulnerabilities:
   Save the scan results (JSON format) to: /opt/course/04/sbom-vulns.json

4. Query the bom-generated SBOM to find all packages that contain "ssl" or "openssl"
   Save the query results to: /opt/course/04/ssl-packages.txt

5. Verify if the package "libcrypto3" exists in the SBOM and save its version
   to: /opt/course/04/libcrypto-version.txt
