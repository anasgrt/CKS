Context:
You need to analyze the software components inside a container image
for supply chain security purposes.

Task:
1. Use the `bom` tool to generate an SBOM for the container image:

   nginx:1.25-alpine

   Save the SBOM to: /opt/course/04/sbom.spdx

2. Query the generated SBOM to find all packages that contain "ssl" or "openssl"

   Save the query results to: /opt/course/04/ssl-packages.txt

3. Verify if the package "libcrypto3" exists in the SBOM and save its version
   to: /opt/course/04/libcrypto-version.txt
