Context:
You have two namespaces: `prod` and `data`.
The namespace `data` is labeled with `env: data`.

Task:
1. Create a NetworkPolicy named `deny-all-ingress` in the `prod` namespace that
   denies ALL ingress traffic to all pods

2. Create a NetworkPolicy named `allow-from-prod` in the `data` namespace that
   allows ingress traffic ONLY from:
   - Pods that are in the `prod` namespace
   - AND those pods must have the label `env: prod`

Requirements:
- Policy 1: deny-all-ingress (in prod namespace)
  - Applies to all pods (empty podSelector)
  - Denies all ingress traffic

- Policy 2: allow-from-prod (in data namespace)
  - Applies to all pods
  - Allows ingress only from prod namespace pods with label env=prod

Save the NetworkPolicy manifests to:
- /opt/course/07/deny-all-ingress.yaml
- /opt/course/07/allow-from-prod.yaml
