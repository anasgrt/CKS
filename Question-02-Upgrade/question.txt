Context:
A worker node named `node01` is running kubelet version 1.34.0.
The control plane is already at version 1.34.1.

Task:
Upgrade the worker node `node01` to version 1.34.1

Steps required:
1. Drain the node (cordon and evict pods)
2. SSH to the worker node
3. Upgrade kubeadm to version 1.34.1
4. Run kubeadm upgrade node
5. Upgrade kubelet and kubectl to version 1.34.1
6. Restart kubelet
7. Uncordon the node

Save the following:
- Pre-upgrade node version: /opt/course/02/node-version-before.txt
- Post-upgrade node version: /opt/course/02/node-version-after.txt

Note: This question simulates the upgrade process. In a real cluster,
you would perform actual package upgrades.
