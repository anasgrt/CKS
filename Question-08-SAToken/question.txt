Domain: Cluster Hardening (15%)
Difficulty: Medium

Context:
A security audit has identified a Deployment improperly handling service account tokens, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

Task:
1. First, modify the existing ServiceAccount stats-monitor-sa in the monitoring namespace to turn off automounting of API credentials.

2. Next, modify the existing Deployment stats-monitor in the monitoring namespace to inject a ServiceAccount token at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token. Use a projected volume named token for the token, and ensure the volume mount is read-only.

3. Configure the token to be valid for the current cluster's API Server. You must determine the correct issuer URL (audience) by inspecting the cluster configuration.

Note: The Deployment's manifest file can be found at ~/stats-monitor/deployment.yaml

Important:
- The ServiceAccount and Deployment already exist - modify them, don't create new ones
- Export the current manifests, edit them, then apply the changes
- Ensure the projected volume includes:
  - expirationSeconds: 3600
  - audience: (discover the correct value for this cluster)
