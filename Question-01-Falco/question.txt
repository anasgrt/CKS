Context:
Three deployments exist in namespace `apps`: `nvidia-gpu`, `cpu`, and `ollama`.
Pods from one of these deployments are accessing `/dev/mem`, causing memory issues on the node.

Task:
1. Use Falco to identify which pod is accessing `/dev/mem`
   - Check Falco logs on the node where the suspicious activity is occurring
   - Identify the specific pod name and container

2. Scale the related deployment to 0 replicas
   - Once you identify the problematic deployment, scale it down

3. Save your findings:
   - Save the pod name to: /opt/course/01/pod-name.txt
   - Save the Falco alert line to: /opt/course/01/falco-alert.txt

Hints:
- Falco logs can be viewed with: journalctl -u falco -f
- Or check: /var/log/falco/falco.log
- Look for alerts related to memory device access
