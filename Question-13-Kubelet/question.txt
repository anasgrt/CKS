Context:
The kubelet on a worker node has insecure configuration settings.
You need to SSH to the node and secure the kubelet.

Task:
SSH to the specified node and secure the kubelet configuration file
located at /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml.

1. Disable anonymous authentication:
   - Set `authentication.anonymous.enabled` to `false`

2. Enable webhook authentication (for token-based auth):
   - Set `authentication.webhook.enabled` to `true`

3. Enable webhook authorization:
   - Set `authorization.mode` to `Webhook`

4. Restart the kubelet service:
   - `systemctl restart kubelet`

5. Verify the node is in Ready state after changes

Save the following:
- Kubelet config before changes: /opt/course/13/kubelet-before.yaml
- Kubelet config after changes: /opt/course/13/kubelet-after.yaml
