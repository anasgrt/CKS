Difficulty: Medium

Context:
The container runtime (containerd) on a cluster node needs to be secured.
You need to SSH to the specified node and harden the containerd configuration.

Task:
SSH to node-01 and perform the following tasks to secure the containerd daemon:

1. Remove user `developer` from any container-related group (do not remove from any other group)

2. Reconfigure containerd to ensure the socket file `/run/containerd/containerd.sock`
   is owned by group `root` (not any container group)

3. Reconfigure containerd to ensure it does not listen on any TCP port
   - Check /etc/containerd/config.toml
   - Remove any "tcp://" addresses in the [grpc] section

4. Restart the containerd daemon

5. Verify the Kubernetes cluster is healthy after your changes

Save the following:
- Containerd socket permissions before: /opt/course/15/socket-before.txt
- Containerd socket permissions after: /opt/course/15/socket-after.txt
- Containerd config.toml content: /opt/course/15/config.toml
