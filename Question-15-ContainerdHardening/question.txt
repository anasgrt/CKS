Context:
The container runtime (containerd) on a cluster node needs to be secured.
You need to SSH to the specified node and verify/harden the containerd configuration.

Task:
SSH to node-01 and perform the following tasks to secure the container runtime:

1. Verify the containerd socket file `/run/containerd/containerd.sock`
   is owned by root:root with appropriate permissions (0660 or more restrictive)

2. Verify containerd is not listening on any TCP port (only unix socket)
   - Check /etc/containerd/config.toml
   - Ensure no TCP listeners are configured in the [grpc] section

3. Check if any non-root users have access to the containerd socket
   - Document any container-related groups

4. Verify the Kubernetes cluster is healthy after your checks

Save the following:
- Containerd socket permissions: /opt/course/15/socket-permissions.txt
- Containerd config grpc section: /opt/course/15/containerd-grpc.txt
- List of container-related groups: /opt/course/15/container-groups.txt

Hints:
- Use `ls -la /run/containerd/containerd.sock` to check socket permissions
- Use `grep -A10 "\[grpc\]" /etc/containerd/config.toml` to check listener config
- Use `getent group | grep -iE "container|docker"` to find container-related groups
