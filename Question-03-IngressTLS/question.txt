Weight: 5%
Domain: Cluster Setup (15%)
Difficulty: Easy

Context:
A TLS secret named `tls-secret` already exists in the namespace `secure-app`.
A service named `secure-service` is already running on port 80.
An Ingress Controller (nginx) is already deployed in the cluster.

Task:
1. Create an Ingress resource named `secure-ingress` in the `secure-app` namespace

2. Configure the Ingress to use the existing TLS secret `tls-secret`

3. Configure the Ingress to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
      - Use the annotation: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"

4. The Ingress should route traffic for host `secure.example.com` to the `secure-service` on port 80

5. Save the Ingress manifest to: /opt/course/03/ingress.yaml

6. Verify the Ingress is working by testing with curl:
      - The host `secure.example.com` should resolve to the Ingress Controller
      - Use curl to verify HTTPS access works (use -k to skip certificate verification)
      - The response should contain "Welcome to secure.example.com"

Requirements:
- Ingress name: secure-ingress
- Namespace: secure-app
- Host: secure.example.com
- TLS secret: tls-secret
- Backend service: secure-service
- Backend port: 80

Verification:
After completing the task, you should be able to verify with:
  curl -k --resolve secure.example.com:443:<INGRESS_IP> https://secure.example.com

The response should show "Welcome to secure.example.com"
