Difficulty: Medium

Context:
A Deployment named `nginx` exists in the `immutable-ns` namespace.
The container filesystem needs to be made immutable at runtime for security.

Task:
Modify the Deployment to ensure the container filesystem is immutable at runtime.

1. Edit the Deployment to add `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` in the container's securityContext

2. The pod may fail to start because nginx needs writable directories.
   Check the logs to identify the required paths (e.g., /var/cache/nginx, /var/run, /tmp)

3. Add `emptyDir` volumes and mount them to the writable paths required by nginx:
   - /var/cache/nginx
   - /var/run
   - /tmp (optional)

4. Ensure the pod is running successfully after the changes

Save the modified Deployment to: /opt/course/14/deployment-immutable.yaml
